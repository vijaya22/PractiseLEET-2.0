/**
 * You are given a 0-indexed 2D integer array peaks where peaks[i] = [xi, yi]
 * states that mountain i has a peak at coordinates (xi, yi).
 * A mountain can be described as a right-angled isosceles triangle,
 * with its base along the x-axis and a right angle at its peak.
 * More formally, the gradients of ascending and descending the mountain are
 * 1 and -1 respectively. A mountain is considered visible
 * if its peak does not lie within another mountain
 * (including the border of other mountains).
 * Return the number of visible mountains.
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * Input: peaks = [[2,2],[6,3],[5,4]]
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation: The diagram above shows the mountains.
 * - Mountain 0 is visible since its peak does not lie within another mountain or its sides.
 * - Mountain 1 is not visible since its peak lies within the side of mountain 2.
 * - Mountain 2 is visible since its peak does not lie within another mountain or its sides.
 * There are 2 mountains that are visible.
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * Input: peaks = [[1,3],[1,3]]
 * Output: 0
 * Explanation: The diagram above shows the mountains (they completely overlap).
 * Both mountains are not visible since their peaks lie within each other.
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 1 <= peaks.length <= 105
 * peaks[i].length == 2
 * 1 <= xi, yi <= 105
